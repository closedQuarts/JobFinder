## üõ† Design, Assumptions, and Decisions

### Architecture

- Microservice Architecture
- Ocelot API Gateway used for routing between services.
- Azure Service Bus for queue messaging between Job Posting creation and Notification Service.
- Redis distributed caching for JobSearch caching.
- Entity Framework Core for database operations.
- React.js frontend communicating via Gateway.

### Assumptions

- Authentication is simple; no JWT yet. Users log in with name and email.
- AI Chatbox integration is not fully implemented but planned with OpenAI.
- Frontend and backend are separately deployed and communicate via Gateway.

### Decisions

- Used Azure SQL for relational storage.
- Redis Cache on Azure.
- Deployment on Azure App Service.
- Frontend built with Create React App.
- Responsive UI inspired by kariyer.net.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

- **Service Bus Consumption**
  - Consuming scoped services (like NotificationRepository) from singleton background services caused DI issues. Solved by restructuring service lifetimes.
- **Redis Authentication**
  - Initial Redis connection failed due to missing authentication config. Solved by updating connection string.
- **Frontend CORS Errors**
  - Solved by configuring CORS on API Gateway.
- **Deployment Errors**
  - 500.30 errors on Azure due to unhandled exceptions in Program.cs. Fixed by handling async calls properly.

## üí° Future Improvements

- Real AI Chat integration with OpenAI.
- JWT authentication & authorization.
- More advanced UI with styling frameworks.
- Load testing with k6 or JMeter.
