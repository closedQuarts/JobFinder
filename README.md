# JobFinder - SE4458 B√ºy√ºk Efe Final Project

This project is a job search platform similar to Kariyer.net, designed for SE4458 Final Project.  
It includes backend REST APIs, Service Bus messaging, distributed caching with Redis, an API Gateway, and a frontend built in React.js.

## üöÄ Final Deployed URLs

- **API Gateway:** [https://jobfindergateway-eshpcwedgjc6f6hs.northeurope-01.azurewebsites.net](https://jobfindergateway-eshpcwedgjc6f6hs.northeurope-01.azurewebsites.net)
- **JobFinder API:** [https://jobfinderapi4458-d3g6fkgca2cfaahb.northeurope-01.azurewebsites.net](https://jobfinderapi4458-d3g6fkgca2cfaahb.northeurope-01.azurewebsites.net)
- **Frontend (React App):** *deploy edilirse link buraya gelecek*

## üõ† Design, Assumptions, and Decisions

### Architecture

- Microservice Architecture
- Ocelot API Gateway used for routing between services.
- Azure Service Bus for queue messaging between Job Posting creation and Notification Service.
- Redis distributed caching for JobSearch caching.
- Entity Framework Core for database operations.
- React.js frontend communicating via Gateway.
- Docker containers for backend and frontend

### Assumptions

- Authentication is simple; no JWT yet. Users log in with name and email.
- AI Chatbox integration is not fully implemented but planned with OpenAI.
- Frontend and backend are separately deployed and communicate via Gateway.

### Decisions

- Used Azure SQL for relational storage.
- Redis Cache on Azure.
- Deployment on Azure App Service.
- Frontend built with Create React App.
- Responsive UI inspired by kariyer.net.

## üéØ Use Cases Covered

‚úÖ Job Posting CRUD  
‚úÖ Job Search (with caching in Redis)  
‚úÖ Notifications for new job postings based on search history  
‚úÖ User login and profile header  
‚úÖ Applying for jobs  
‚úÖ AI Chatbot (backend API) for job search queries  
‚úÖ API Gateway routing with Ocelot

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

- **Service Bus Consumption**
  - Consuming scoped services (like NotificationRepository) from singleton background services caused DI issues. Solved by restructuring service lifetimes.
- **Redis Authentication**
  - Initial Redis connection failed due to missing authentication config. Solved by updating connection string.
- **Frontend CORS Errors**
  - Solved by configuring CORS on API Gateway.
- **Deployment Errors**
  - 500.30 errors on Azure due to unhandled exceptions in Program.cs. Fixed by handling async calls properly.

## üí° Future Improvements

- Real AI Chat integration with OpenAI.
- JWT authentication & authorization.
- More advanced UI with styling frameworks.
- Load testing with k6 or JMeter.
